1) Memoization and dynamic programming
1:50 subproblem
3:30 fibonacci number
8:08 memoization, write your self a memo, 
	store the generated value in table
12:03 sample code of fibonacci
13:47 dynamic programmic, strategy to optimize memoize table
17:30 dynamic programming, sample program for fibonacci

2) grid paths
3:43 explanation for combinatorial solution
	why combinatorial not permutation ? because order matters
15:55 memoization vs dynamic programming 
	it is always better to use dynamic programming

3) longest common subsequence 
	subword -> continuous sequence of character
			secret, secretary -> secret
	subseq  -> jump in the mactching sequence is allowed
			secret, rect -> ret
	must revisit the video to understand better


4) matrix multiplication
	i4:05 sequence in which associative matric multiplication can change compuation

5) Wrap
