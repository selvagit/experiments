1) lecture 1: Introduction
	archeitect
		cmos (up to 22nm)
		finfet (14nm)	
	steps
		specification
		synthesis
		simulation
		layout
		testability analysis

	conversion, 
		hdl provide formats for representing the outputs of varios desing steps
		behaviour to register transfer level
		register transfer level to gate level
		gate level to transistor level
		transistor level to layout	

	design level
		behavioural design
		data path design
		logic design
		physical design
		manufacturing

2) lecture 2 : Design representation
	4:29 y diagram
        11:36 full adder
	18:00 strutural representation			
		use equation, behaviour
		use function for representation each operation, structural
		use function in net
			but contains details about wire like alumium, poly silicon

3) lecture 3 : getting started with verilog
	3:50 instantion create a copy of the module	
	26:50 Desing under test 
	34:40 simulation result
		vcd -> value change dump

4) lecture 4 : vlsi design styles -1 	
	2:42 vlsi design cycle	
	7:05 fpga
		i/o cells
		LUT 
		SRAM
		ANTI FUSE
	10:10 XC4000 Architecture
		programmable interconnect
		configuratble logic block
		I/O blocks
5) lecture 5: vlsi desing styles -2 
	0:00 gate array	
		design implementation is done with metal mask design and processing
		create a standard mask based wafer
		then create a custom mask for the given design	
			total cost gets distrubute across the milliosn of chip
	7:53 standard cell
		ASIC
			standard cell (semi cost)
			full custom cell	
		most prevalent
		required developing full custom mask set
	14:00 standard cell example
		study the colouring of the stick diagram
		cell jump through through cells
		cell are standard
	22:45 	memory chip always are full custom chip
		layout is very regular
	25:51	comparison between different design styles
