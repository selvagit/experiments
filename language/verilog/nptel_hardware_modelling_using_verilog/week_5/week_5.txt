1) mod05lec21 : verilog test bench
1:11 procedural block that exist only once
2:25 only for simulation
5:45 example
11:50 $display, similar to printf c
15:15 $monitor, similar to printf c, only on change, event driven
18:00 $finish terminate the excecution
18:50 $dumpfile <filename> 
	$dumpoff
	$dumpon
21:30 $dumpvars

2) mod05lev22 writing verilog test benches
2:09 full adder testbench
8:08 for loop test bench
10:30 dumpfile & dumpvars
15:56 four bit shift register
20:45 explanation of the clock in timing
26:08 7 bit binary counter
28:00 full adder self checking test bench
30:40 generating random test vector
	$random <seed>

3) mod05lec23 modelling finite state machines 
4:48 finite state machine, can be represented using the state transition diagram or table
	algorithm state machine
7:02 state transition diagram
11:13 Mealy and moore fsm 
	mealy based on both input and state
	moore only based on state
14:39	pi -> primary input
	ps -> primary state
	NS -> next state
	po -> primary output
16:43 lamp state machine
	because of non-blocking statement assingment flip-flop are generated  
	can be avoided by the creation of non-blocking statement without depending on clock 

4) mod05lec24
0:30 serial parity detector
4:30 program for serial parity detector
13:00 parity_gen program without the generation of the latch for the output
15:00 mealy machine
	overlapping sequence is also detected
22:00 next state logic
30:19 serial adder
	need to study how the state diagram are made
