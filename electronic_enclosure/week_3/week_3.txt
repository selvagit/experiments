1) (ncr-lec11) how to create a routine object
	orange juice
		handle
		seed catcher 
		spout
		made of glass
		improvementi made steel
			proper strainer	
		improvement made of plastic
			not athestically pleasant	
		made of ceramic
			not affected by acid
		desing 
			silicone based squeezer 
			poking desing
			lever based desing
			power desing
		emotional design (book)
		pratice design, sketching, line weight, card board model
			sketch a multimeter
		take a look around, improve all your things

2) (ncr-lec12) simple mechanical enclosure 
		easy and available		
		any size provided it is within CEDT capabilities
			30mm to 300mm 3d envelope	
		quick, last minute, can be painted and graphics added
		can be repaired 
		why not
			short circuit
			finish depends on the detailed design
			a little bit brain work required to explain 
		where not to start
			laying out of pcb
		have an overall from factor
		get familiar with kressey approach
			mit course ware 
		this form will help you
	 		maintain overall propotions and aid in appropriate semantics of your product
			an acceptable start is to have competing solution for your product on hand	
		have an estimate of area required for your circuit
		gross black schematic divided logically into managable elements
			detailed schematic of where and how your system can be split
			decide on the interface details 
			decide on the electrical i/o interface details 
			wires, connectors? wireless ,ir, rf?
			decide on the human interface details 
			display, keys/microphones, loud speakers jacks, ir receiver etc
		get details of each and everything
			without details there are no product 
			gather all details of each component, 
				especially the large volume items starting from psu components, display connectors keys, battery holders, all the way to small wires
				(bunched wire harness cable stays and grommets are still a nuiisance)
		
		start a layout
			arrange all the component in relation to each other
			look at what is likely to be visible outside 	
			arrange all the important features like the display items where they should be on the enclsoure
		keep going inside , put together all the internal electronic hardware
			make space for cable and wiring inside the equipment
			ensure that all the elements are connected as per the schematic
			make a best fir guess as to how to well things are likely to stay together	
		Add mechanical hardware that can hold and fix the elements
			how is a pcb held?
			is the connector fixed on the shell or the pcb
			what is the size of the fastener?
			replacable component should be isolated	
		
3) nvr-lev13
	Rearrange the layout in case the parts seems to fall out
		this process is iterative and repeatative
		at least three attempts are needed, donot release ip early
		eventually some stage will be reached, where compromise has to be made 
			design is compromise, trade off
			designer should decide what is the most important part that is retained
		optimization of the space, layout or cost is what it is all about
		have a look at the other aspects thermal, EMI, effect on aesthetics, effect on usability, and manufacturing aspects
	Freeze one of the alternatives as good solutions
		start working on the external features
		does the look and feel is as per the original concept 
		make a best-fit attempt
		start making form detailing on the external appearances
			does it look bulky? unbalanced? make corrections
			if cannot be hidden, highligth it
		make a full assembly corrections		
	now is the time for all goof men to come to the aid of the party
		make the outline of pcb, remember all the pcb hardware, where to hold, screw down		
		extract and take the outline to the eda tools
		make the pcb layout, if there is any change in the overall size, do it now
	put together a structure diagram
		a network of all the parts in relation to each other	
	start extracting part drawing from your original assembly drawing
		in the final design the parts will have to be assembled in a sequential manner
		each assembly will be tested and snapped together
		after the final product is put together, it will have to work with minimum interventions
		
	start fabrication
		fits and tolerance
		dissemble the enclosure
		start putting all the electronic sub assemblies in place
		wire up the whole equipment
		power up 
		try the electrical functions, usually in the case open condition
		load all the necessary software 
		disasemble , paint

4) nvr-lev14
	acrylic	
		optical index is same of water
	steel metal 
	       for thin shape
