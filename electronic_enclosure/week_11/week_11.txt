1) ncr lec 49
1:30) mouse
4:11 constraints are known, multiple solutions are possible 
5:44 cad should be used through out the design
	but sketch are used for pliminary purpose
7:30 was introduce in 1960
	original was done for drawing
	used in injection moulding
12:08 orginally inhouse development was done  was by automobile and aeroplane manufacture
13:20 3d isometric perspectives
	intoduced by IBM-dassaults
14:00 product lifecycle management 
	solidedge, solidworks, unigraphics nx
14:47 wire-frame models
	cube is difficult to intepretate
16:44 surface models
	since nothing is the background is visible, it is realistic
19:26 solid model , they are the most usefull 
	they appear to be same as surface models
	in addition they have weight, volume and density 

2) nvr lec 50
0:40 constructive solid modelling
	difficult to rework
3d boundary represenation solid modeeling
3d hybrod solid modelling
	csg and brep solid modelling
3d feature based solid modelling
	preferred modelling method
3d feature base parametric solid modelling
	parameter are available for each arch, line 
	parameter can be changed, they control location of the entities within the model
	history-base method for keep a record of how the model was built
	constrains can be added
	allow other method of relating entitied as well
	is efficient for dimensional changes then features changes`	
12:00 3d feature based, dynamic solid modelling
	uses flexible model creation and refinement concepts to allow designers to capture ideas and details models quickly
22:02 autodesk inventor -3d 
	creo parametric parametric pro -e
26:15 ds caita dassault systemes
	rich surface modelling is required
26:30 nx unigraphics  siemens 
solidworks has list a of mechnical library

3) nvr lec 51
1:00 ac design
5:00 make things easy
	build accurate representation
	sizes, opening, radii
	scaling is easy
	duplicating is the core
	library can be built up
	online availability
14:42 down stream producability
	perfect match
	input from nebulous concepts in the mind
	output to the usable data specs, dimensions
	other desing stages
	normalisation , standardisation value engineering
	prototyping
21:13 what gets my attention
	primitive intuitive
	buildup frame basic lines , surfaces, curves, solids
	unexplored features
	easy select objects
	layers, dimensioning
	attributes of entities
	export and import

4) nvr lec 52
what can be done with it
	fabrication of sheet metal
	machine shop work
	model making
		archeitecture 
		water piping
		fire hazard 
		architecture
	rapid prototyping
		fused filament depositing, liquid
		laser cutting	
no rules, think it, do it
	patience, play, practice, plan for the next time
	try all online tutorials, blogs, groups
	get trained

9:52) 555 timer
	veroboard, 
	wish board, breadboard

13:10) stop clock

15:09) timmer for watering the garden

17:50) example of kit for lab
	plan view for correct dimension
	layer with different color, red color for pcb, it can be enabled and disabled

21:26) rhinocero, health care system
	step motor, pulley, guide
	cover part of it

23:39) dual mode with wifi and gsm 


5) nvr lec 53
0:00 water analysing device
	not pure hydraulic, pneumatic
2:17 micro well device
	depending of the placement of various feature, layout can be optimized
4:15 torch given as simple excercise
	reajustment of the reflector affect the battery placement
	a single object from the composite diagram can be exported like battery in the torch
	get the student version try to create a single battery holder

6) nvr lec 54
2:38 dimension are specific to domain
4:44 enclosure 
	3 different parts
	wireframe shows numerous thing related to constructed lines
8:30 prototype board
		power supply
		on/off connector
		connector
9:00 hoppy circuit
11:26 off the self small enclosure 
14:39 rapid prototyping machine
19:00 deviation from the regular norm for labelling of the button 
	but the device is meant for professional who will read the manual
21:00 steel metal enclosure
