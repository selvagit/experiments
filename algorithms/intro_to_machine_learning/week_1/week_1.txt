1) intput + output = program /model 

2) learning -> 
	ability to improve behaviour based on experience 

3) machine learninA
	learning from data
	builds model
	model can be used for decision making  

4) formal definition
	a program is said to learn from experience E from Task T with performance measure P and improves E

5) choose
	traning experience
	target function ( expect output)
	representation of the target function
	learning algorithm to infer the target function

1) different types of machine learning
	supervised learning , had labelled data
	unsupervised learning , has not lablled data
	re-inforcement learning , agent acting in enviroment , action based on reward
	unsupervised learning

2) supervise learning
	different features X1 , X2 --- Xn
	corresponding ouput Y1,Y2--Yn
	output can be discrete value or continuous valued
		discrete value are classification problem (yes,no)
		continuous values are regression problem (price of a used car)

1) Hypothesis space and inductive bias
	inductive learning / prediction 
	classification, regression, probaility estimation 
	not a well defined problem is inductive problem if not it is detection problem
	hypothesis space is set of all possible model (h E H)
	terminology
		example
		traning data, set of examples
		instance spacei (X), set of all possible objects described by feature
		concept c (c is subset of X) 
		target function f (f.x->y)
	restrict hypothesis bt defining bias
		constraints (strong condition)
		preferences (weak condition )

	why set is discussed as subset while the hypothesis is discussed as part of the hypothesis not a subset ? set is colleciton of points, which hypothesis is a single function  

	number of possible boolean function is pow(2,pow(2,n)) ? how is this possible , number of ossible subset of instance 
	number of possible instance pow(2,n)

	hypothesis language 
		is the algorithm useod
		reflect the inductive bias 
	hyposthesis error
		bias error, wrong constrains  
		variance error , because of smaller set 
		over fitting and underfitting

1) evaluating the performacne of learning system
	Experimental evaluation
		error
		accuracy
		precision
	Absolute error = (sum(abs(h(x)-y))/n 
		good for regression problem
	sum of square error = sum ( square (h(x) -y))/n 
		good for regression problem
	Number of misclassification = (sum ( delta ( h(x),y)))/n
		delta(x) can be set of {0,1}

	confustion matrix
		diagnol elements is where the hyposthesis and true class match
		more that 2 class is possible
		
		pos	Neg
	pos	TP	FP
	
	neg	FN	TN


	Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (P+N)
	precision = TP/(TP+FP)
	recall = TP/P

	Sample error ---- ?
	True error --- ?
	
	Orignial set = training + validation + testing

	k-fold cross validation 
		split into k subset 
		k round of learning
		find the avergage of all the rounds
