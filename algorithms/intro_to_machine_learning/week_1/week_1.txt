1) intput + output = program /model 

2) learning -> 
	ability to improve behaviour based on experience 

3) machine learninA
	learning from data
	builds model
	model can be used for decision making  

4) formal definition
	a program is said to learn from experience E from Task T with performance measure P and improves E

5) choose
	traning experience
	target function ( expect output)
	representation of the target function
	learning algorithm to infer the target function
