// this file is meant for testing the algorithms by comparing two directory
// for finding the duplicate files and measure time taken by each algorithm to 
// search the directory 
//
// Steps to done
// 1) Open a directory
// 2) find all the files and directory 
// 3) Create a database of all the files found 
// 4) for every new file found compare it with the existing data base and report if the file already exist
// 5) use different search algorithm to search 
// 6) use arguement list option library to add command line option 
// 7) OpenMPI / OpenCL can used for scaling
