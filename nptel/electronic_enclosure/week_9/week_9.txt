1) nvcr lec40:: off the shelf aluminum enclosures
2:00 extrution are available in various lenght
3:15 ip65 cases 
	temperorary immersion is possible
	visible fasterner is available
	protect corner to prevent shattering
	using elastomer/rubber
7:07 labelling is below can not be seen on insertion of the cable 
8:30 explanation of the container
13:10 aluminum grade a6063s-T5
	T5 refers to the anealing capability
15:40 anodized layer is non conductive, aluminum oxide is non conductive
	anodized finish
	earthing does not happen automatically
17:33 notes for installing the kit
	small portion of the cover gasket protrudes for maintaining with the panel gasket for ip65 protection
27:07 multiple combination are provide with gasket details
	1.7 mm grove run through length extrution
	3.5 mm pitch run through extrution
		what is pitch and grove
			pcb can slide along the grove
			emering the grove
33:12 other hardware can be mounted other than pcb
	loading bearing member (nuts) can be used using the nut grooves

2) nvcr lec 41 :: understanding boxes documentation
0:30 metric thread , in us unc (unified national, unf, unc ) is used 
	thread pitch is standard
	hight of the nut is standard
	tapped nuts are usefull for easy position in the case
3:30 in aero space 0.6 - 0.8 mm distance in length and height of the pcb screw are put 
4:26  totall amount of bending is minimize
	military grade testing 
		quater sine wave shock
		search out for resonance for strobe
8:39  giving half section
	top portion 
	bottom portion 
	test procedure for checking the leakage 
		fill the enclosure with cold air
		dip the enclosure in hot(80-90 deg) distilled water 
		check for bubble
12:00 emc shielding rubber gasket
	2.5 mm diameter 
18:00 engraving operation, paint filling in the engrave
24:14 cnc machining, supplier will help in generating the G-code which will help in cutting
27:00 eda file are understood by the software


3) nvcr lec 42 :: heat sink enclosures 
1:15 desk phone 
	chance of misuse by bending
	section are made of plastics, strength is limited
	cradle is available
	yellow knob for increasing volume
	power on/off 
5:35 heat-sink alumium enclosure
6:58 heat transfer 
	radiator is not in a car, heat exchanger 
	heat transfer via sheet metal spreader, metal fitting bracket 
13:18 effectiveness of heat sink
14:45 rf amplifier
	top is heat extrution
	bottom does not have it
18:50 power bank in a aluminum casing
20:00 different types of sink
	pin type heat-sink for better cooling performance
	heat sink plate can be customized as ventilation slit for better cooling
	black does not help
	radiation is not color sensitivity at the temp we are discussing
	protection class ip40 

4) nvcr lec 43 :: detailing of built in heat sink boxes 
0:15 a,b mouting dimensions, c is width 
2:11 as length and width changes the thermal reistance rate
	as dimension increase the resistance decreases
6:00 grooves width in panel is related to the pcb copper tracing
12:21 standard alumium for heat sink
14:20 special heat sink
15:00 heat sink problem
	how to transfer the heat to the wall
	how to keep the enclosure sealed
20:00 import the pdf file into the cad tool
	placement of the heat source, load can be added, which can be supplied for pcb layout
	

5) nvcr lec 44 :: connector basics 
02:40 remove part for servicing
max kilowatt wiring in the house, sum all the power consumption of all the devices in the house
