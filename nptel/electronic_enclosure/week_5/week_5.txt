1) lec20
	45 degree bends	
	all operation should be done in flat condition
		before forming, bending
	telephone
		ergonomic and aesthic	
	studio 
	job shop
	reusable
		polycarbonate material cannot be recycled
	development drawing
	repeatable structure

2) lec 21
	user vernier to mark the dimensions, height gauge 
	
	folding machine, with fingers
		use square for alignment
	
	after folding remeasure the dimension
	door lock 
		embossing 
		fold over
		shear formed
		no notch
	alumiunium welding
		argon gas welding
		wire feed inside
		tungsten sheild arc
	horizontal machining 
	vertical machining tool

	bending & detection allowance + internal dimension
	hat section

	make reference from a datum, horizontal 
	hole of higher dimension is better punched, drilling for smaller dimension

	mark the clamp line 	
	51:00 notching of corner
	punch for hole
	what ever is inside the finger dimension will not change
	check the spring back option
	v punch machine

3) lec 22
	top portion has bend has a problem	
	E-I lamination, transformer
	made using stamping die
	tension ratio depends mostly on geomentry
	neutral axis is 1/3 for tight corner, 1/2 for other
	inner and outer rings are not concentric

4) lec 23
	set
	benchworks
	sheetmetalworks 	 

5) lec 24
	bend allowance 
	bend deduction	
	v bend
	u bend
	wiping die bending
	double die bending
	rotary bending	
	deep drawing
	perfect bend can be done by welding
	edge rounding is required
