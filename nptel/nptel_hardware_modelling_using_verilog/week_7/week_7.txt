1) mod07lec30.webm modelling memory
1:17 two dimensional element is memory
3:30 available as pre defined library
	memory layout is different from cpu
8:00 readmemb (read memory binary) readmemh (read memory hex)  used for filling the memory from a file
10:00 memory module has chip select, clk, read & write signal  
11:00 avoid inout data type because there is not consistent data type definition across simulator and systhesis tool
	inout is type of wire
14:50 example eprom
18:22 data_in and data_out lines are separate
20:00 use tristate bus to create a bi directional bus 
	why we canot use the tri state inside a memory module itself
23:43 ram_3 example


2) mod07lec31.webm modelling register bank
i6:00 same register will not be read and written simultaneously
	2 reg read and one write is allowed per clock
8:21 sr1 -> source register 1
	sr2 -> source register 2
	dr -> destination register
13:22 example code using a array
22:00 confused with the delay time variable 
	#10 inisde the for loop and #7 outside the for loop


3) mod07lec32.webm Basic pipelining concept
	stages are combinational circuit
	latches are flipflop , intermediatery stage
16:43 linear pipeline, non-linear pipeline
	non-linear pipeline multiple path can be taken
18:00 reservation table
	x-axis show the time steps
	y-axis shows the stages
21:00 speedup and efficiency
	
4) mod07lec33.webm pipeline modelling 

5) mod07lec34.webm 
9.50  sela -> select A
	NEGA -> ~A 
	SRA -> shift right A by 1 position
	SLA -> shift left A by 1 position
11:48 pipeline diagram
13:30 clocking issue in pipeline

5) mod07lec35.webm switch modelling 
	check the psuedo nor implementation
